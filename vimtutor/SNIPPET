  1. Move the cursor to this line.

  2. Press  v  and move the cursor to include everything including the fifth item below.
     Notice that the text is highlighted.

  3. Press the  :  character.  At the bottom of the screen  :'<,'> will appear.

  4. Type  w SNIPPET  , where SNIPPET is the name of the file that we will save.
     Verify that you see  :'<,'>w SNIPPET  before you press <ENTER>.

  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file SNIPPET.  Use  :!ls
     to see it.  Do not remove it!  We will use it in the next lesson, and you'll
     need it for your CS400 submission.
