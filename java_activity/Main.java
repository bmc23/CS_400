// Edit this file and add Java code so that it compiles.
// You will need to define a class as well as at least one method to run code.
// Your program should at least output a string to the user when running it.
// The string can be any string, but it is required to contain the Java hash code
// for your @wisc.edu email address. To get the hash code in Java (Java has a
// built-in hashCode function for many types of objects, including Strings),
// create a String object with your email address, and then call the .hashCode()
// method on it. This method will return an int (this can be any int, including
// negative ones). Convert this int to a String and include it in your program
// output
 class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
String email = "bmclarke@wisc.edu";
	System.out.println("my email is bmclarke@wisc.edu and its hashcode is "  + email.hashCode());
}
}
